# Changelog

## [1.1.1] - 2024-10-5

- Fix package.json so that when using `import`, it imports the correct ES module. Thank you @fezproof!

## [1.1.0] - 2024-03-16

- Add `applyBestPrefix` method to choose and apply the best prefix for a Unit. Thank you @adrfantini for the contribution.

## [1.0.2] - 2023-11-24

- Set `exports` in `package.json`, which fixes imports in Node and Deno when using `require` or `import()`

## [1.0.1] - 2023-10-21

_This is an attempt to correctly export types._

### Fixed

- Set `module` entry point in package.json to `es/UnitMath.js`
- Set `types` in package.json to `es/UnitMath.d.ts`

## [1.0.0] - 2023-02-20

V1 is a major rewrite of UnitMath in TypeScript. While most of the API remains the same, V1 does introduce several breaking changes from v0.8.7. See [Migrating to v1](migrating-to-v1.md) for details.

- `toString` no longer simplifies units. You must now explicitly call `simplify` for the unit to be simplified.
- Removed `simplify` and `simplifyThreshold` options.
- Removed `definitions.quantities` and `definitions.baseQuantities`.
- Renaned `definitions.unitSystems` to `definitions.systems`
- Renamed `definitions.prefixes` to `definitions.prefixGroups`
- Each system defined in `definitions.systems` is now just a string array of units assigned to that system.
- Removed `autoAddToSystem` option, since it is now much easier to add units to a system.
- Customer formatters no longer accept additional user arguments.

## [1.0.0-rc.2] - 2023-02-19
- `toString` no longer simplifies units. The user must now explicitly call `simplify` for the unit to be simplified.
- Removed `simplifyThreshold` option, since units are now only simplified when calling `simplify`.
- Many updates to the README.
- Many tests had to be altered to reflect the changes to `toString` and `simplify`.
